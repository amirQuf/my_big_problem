# Keyboard Layout Auto-Corrector
 My big problem was solved with a little solution. It would be better to work on your typing skills, my friend.:)
## Overview

The **Keyboard Layout Auto-Corrector** is a tool designed to fix the common problem of typing with the wrong keyboard layout. For example, when you intend to type in English but your keyboard is set to Persian (or vice versa), the result is unreadable “gibberish” text. This program detects such mistakes and automatically converts them into the intended language.

Example:

* Mistyped: `لخخع`
* Corrected: `test`

---

## Features

* 🔄 Convert gibberish text typed in **Persian layout to English layout** and vice versa.
* ⚡ Detect whether the input word is gibberish (invalid in the current language).
* 📝 Provide clean API functions for conversion (`fa_to_en`, `en_to_fa`).
* 🔌 Can be integrated as a:

  * **CLI tool**
  * **Python library**
  * **Browser extension** (future feature)
  * **Text editor plugin**

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/keyboard-layout-fixer.git
cd keyboard-layout-fixer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Python API

```python
from layout_fixer import detect_gibberish, fix_layout

word = "لخخع"
if detect_gibberish(word):
    corrected = fix_layout(word)
    print(corrected)  # Output: test
```

### 2. Command Line

```bash
python fixer.py "لخخع"
# Output: test
```

## How It Works

1. **Character Mapping**
   A dictionary maps each key in the Persian layout to its English counterpart (and vice versa).

   Example:

   * `ل` → `t`
   * `خ` → `e`
   * `ع` → `s`

2. **Gibberish Detection**

   * If the string contains only characters from one alphabet but does not form valid words, it’s flagged as gibberish.
   * Optionally use a dictionary check (e.g., `en_US` word list).

3. **Auto Correction**

   * When gibberish is detected, the system attempts conversion using the mapping.
   * If the result forms valid words in the target language, it replaces the text.

---

## Roadmap

* [x] Basic mapping functions (`fa_to_en`, `en_to_fa`).
* [x] Simple gibberish detection (alphabet + word list check).
* [ ] Context-aware suggestions (predict intended words).
* [ ] Browser extension (for Gmail, WhatsApp Web, etc.).
* [ ] Integration with VS Code / Sublime / JetBrains editors.
